# Classify Waste Products Using Transfer Learning with VGG16

In this project, I will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images of waste products into recyclable and organic categories. The goal is to develop an automated system that can accurately differentiate between types of waste to improve sorting efficiency and reduce contamination.

Working in collaboration with EcoClean, a company aiming to automate its waste sorting process, this project addresses the challenges of manual sorting, which is labor-intensive and prone to errors.

By fine-tuning the VGG16 model on a dataset of waste images, I will train and evaluate a classifier that can be applied in real-world waste management to boost automation and environmental sustainability.

This project will help me build practical skills in Computer Vision and transfer learning, using a powerful pre-trained convolutional neural network to solve an important environmental problem.
